When contributing changes to individual cookbooks, please do not
modify the version number in the metadata.rb. Also please do not
update the CHANGELOG.md for a new version. Not all changes to a
cookbook may be merged and released in the same versions. Chef Software will
handle the version updates during the release process. You are welcome
to correct typos or otherwise make updates to documentation in the
README.
